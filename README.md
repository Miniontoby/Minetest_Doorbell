"Doorbell" created by "Miniontoby"

I have made a doorbell mod with a doorbell and a delete tool. 


Working:

When you push the doorbell there is coming a doorbell_sound only at the person who's hosting the server or only singleplayer.


Recipe:

- = none,  | = book,  \ = doorbell

Doorbell{

- - -
| | |
- - -
}

Delete tool{

- - -
- \ -
- - -
}


History:

I have made It when I was just 10 years old, but now I'm 13 years old and I made the delete tool 
I made the delete tool because I couldn't delete the doorbell. 


You can use the delete tool for every node and it look like as the nodebreaker in the mod "Pipeworks".
